## Intro

The `add` command is used to add a new component to a project.

```bash copy
umi add
```

## Options

| Option | Description | Default |
| ------- | --- | --- |
| `-n, --name <name>` | The name of the component to add. | None |
| `--list` `-l` | List available components. (under development) | None |

## Examples

### Adding a name for your new component

```bash copy
umi add --name Button
```
```bash copy
umi add -n Button
```

### List available components (Under development)

```bash copy
umi add --list
```
```bash copy
umi add -l
```

## Usage

<Step>
  <StepItem title="Running The Command">

    Get started by running the command

    ```bash
    umi add
    ```

  </StepItem>
  <StepItem title="Select A Component">

    Choose a component from the list of available components. This will clone the component from the
    [umi-digital/ui](https://github.com/umi-labs/umi/tree/main/packages/ui/output) package.

    ```bash
    ✔ Components repository cloned.
    ? Select a component to add: › - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
    ❯ Button
    FieldSet
    Form
    Heading
    Hero_1
    Input
    TextArea
    ```

  </StepItem>
  <StepItem title="Name Your Component">

    Next enter the name for the component you are looking to add.

    ```bash
    ✔ Components repository cloned.
    ✔ Select a component to add: › Hero_1
    Selected component: Hero_1
    Component category: heros
    ? What is the name of the component? ›
    ```

    You will also notice that your terminal is showing the component category and the component name.
    This is because the component is being added to the `shared` directory within the `_components` directory. In the
    future, this will be configurable.

  </StepItem>
  <StepItem title="Scaffolding & Importing">

    Great! Now you have chosen your name, we do a few things in the background to get the component set up - if these
    have been done correctly you should see the messages below.

    ```bash
    ✔ Components repository cloned.
    ✔ Select a component to add: › Hero_1
    Selected component: Hero_1
    Component category: heros
    ✔ What is the name of the component? … hero-1
    ✔ Component name validated.
    ✔ Component "hero1" added successfully!
    ✔ Component schema file added successfully!
    ⠋ Adding imports...Import and component added successfully!
    ✔ Imports added
    ```

    The component has been added to the `shared` directory within the `_components` directory. The component is also
    imported into the `index.js` file in the `schemas` directory.

  </StepItem>
  <StepItem title="Checking the Component">

    Now that the component has been added, you can start using the component within your project.

    But first, let's check the component to make sure it is working correctly.

    Open the `app/_components/shared/heros/hero1.tsx` file, if you followed along with this guide you should see
    something similar to the following:

    ```tsx showLineNumbers
    import {cn} from '@/lib/utils'

    interface Hero_1Props {
    data: {
    tagline: string
    heading: string
    descritpion: string
    image: {
    src: string
    alt: string
    width: number
    height: number
  }
  }
    textAlignHoz?: ('left' | 'center' | 'right') | undefined
    textAlignVer?: ('top' | 'center' | 'bottom') | undefined
    variant?: ('primary' | 'secondary' | 'tertiary') | undefined
  }

    export default function Hero1({
    data,
    textAlignHoz = 'center',
    textAlignVer,
  }: Hero_1Props) {
    return (
    <section className="h-screen w-full relative flex items-center justify-center">
    <div className="absolute top-0 left-0 z-0 h-screen w-full">
    <div className="absolute top-0 left-0 z-0 h-screen w-full bg-gradient-to-b from-black/50 to-black" />
    <picture className="">
    <source srcSet={data.image.src} />
  <img
    src={data.image.src}
    alt={data.image.alt}
    width={data.image.width}
    height={data.image.height}
    className="object-cover object-center h-screen w-full"
  />
</picture>
</div>
<div
  className={cn(
    'z-10 text-white gap-4 max-w-[768px] mx-auto',
    `text-${textAlignHoz}`,
    textAlignVer,
  )}
>
  <span className="text-base font-semibold">{data.tagline}</span>
  <div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center gap-6">
    <h1 className="text-6xl font-bold">{data.heading}</h1>
    <p className="text-lg">{data.descritpion}</p>
  </div>
</div>
</section>
)
}
```

The first thing to check are the imports, ensure that they are correctly linking up where they need to and there aren't any type issues etc.

Next lets check the type - this has be dynamically generated when @umi-digital/ui gets built, this means that there aren't many meaningful ways of testing this and so there may be some mistakes. Check this now.

Finally, ensure that there are no other errors with the component.

Moving onto the schema we need to head to `sanity/schemas/objects/hero1.js`. You should see something similar to this:

```js showLineNumbers
import { defineType } from 'sanity'

export default defineType({
'hero_1',
'Hero_1',
  type: 'object',
  fields: [
  {
    name: 'data',
    title: 'Data',
    type: 'object',
  },
  {
    name: 'textAlignHoz',
    title: 'TextAlignHoz',
    type: 'object',
  },
  {
    name: 'textAlignVer',
    title: 'TextAlignVer',
    type: 'object',
  },
  {
    name: 'variant',
    title: 'Variant',
    type: 'object',
  },
],
  preview: {
  prepare()
  {
    return {
      title: 'Hero_1',
    }
  }
,
},
})
```

<Note title="Nested Fields" type="">
  Nested fields are not currently supported, but will be added in the future. For now please complete these fields
  manually.
</Note>

Check that this follows the type as shown in the component as this will make your workflow a lot easier.

## Next Steps

Congrats! Now you have a component added to your project. You can now start modifying the component to suit your needs.
