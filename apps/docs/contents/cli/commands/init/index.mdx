## Intro

The init command is used to initialise a new project.

```bash copy
umi init
```

## Options

| Option | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-y, --yes` | Skip prompts and use default values. | None |
| `-n, --name <name>` | Set the name of the project | None |

## Examples

### Initialising a new project

```bash copy
umi init
```

### Skipping prompts

```bash copy
umi init --yes
```
```bash copy
umi init -y
```

### Adding a name

```bash copy
umi init --name my-project
```
```bash copy
umi init -n my-project
```

## How it works

The init command uses the `init` command from the `@umi-digital/cli` package to initialise a new project. This command checks if there is an `umirc.json` file in the directory
and if not then creates the file. It then asks the user for values whilst providing defaults.

<Note title="Note" type="warning">
  **It is ~strongly~ _very strongly_ suggested that you just choose these defaults.**
</Note>

Your configuration file should look like this (however as this project is under constant development, the exact structure may change):

```json
{
  "name": "test",
  "aliases": {
    "components": "components",
    "utils": "utils",
    "hooks": "hooks",
    "api": "api",
    "ui": "ui"
  }
}
```
