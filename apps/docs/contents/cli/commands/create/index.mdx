  <StepItem title="Running The Command">

    Get started by running the command

    ```bash
    umi create
    ```

  </StepItem>
  <StepItem title="Project Name">

    Next enter the name for the project you are looking to build.

    ```bash
    What is the name of the new project? ›
    ```

  </StepItem>
  <StepItem title="Select Your Template">

    Great! Now you have chosen your name, we do a few things in the background to get the directory set up - if these
    have been done correctly you should see the messages below. Select a template from those presented to you (the
    templates below may vary to from what you can see as this repo will develop overtime).

    ```bash
    ✔ What is the name of the new project? … Test
    ✔ Directory setup complete.
    ✔ Templates cloned.
    ? Select a template: › - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
    ❯ basic
    marketing
    ```

  </StepItem>
  <StepItem title="Select Your Package Manager">

    Congratulations, this is the final step needed to scaffold your project. Again, most of what is happening in the
    background is then relayed to you the user through the terminal with messages and their status. Select a package
    manager from the available below and the project will begin to build.

    ```bash
    ✔ What is the name of the new project? … Test
    ✔ Directory setup complete.
    ✔ Templates cloned.
    ✔ Select a template: › basic
    ✔ Template copied.
    ? Which package manager would you like to use? › - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
    ❯ pnpm - Recommended
    npm
    yarn
    ```

  </StepItem>
  <StepItem title="Installation">

    Your project should now scaffold itself into the directory with the name you have provided. If you need to overwrite
    a previous directory, the tool will ask you if this is okay before proceeding.

    ```bash
    ✔ What is the name of the new project? … Test
    ✔ Directory setup complete.
    ✔ Templates cloned.
    ✔ Select a template: › basic
    ✔ Template copied.
    ✔ Which package manager would you like to use? › pnpm
