To install the **UMI CLI**, you will need to check for several prerequisites, install the package globally and then ensure it is installed correctly on your system.

## Install

<Step>
  <StepItem title="System Requirements">

    - **Node.js:** Make sure you have Node.js installed. This is crucial for the installation and use of the package.
    - **Package Manager:** This project was built to be package manager agnostic so that `pnpm`, `npm` and `yarn`
    commands all work the same, ensure that your chosen package manager is installed.

    To verify installation, run:

    ```bash
    node -v
    ```

    > We are currently running support for node 18.19.0. However we are working bring a wider array of versions
    supported.

    And then checking your package manager of choice is installed, run:

    <Note title="Package Manager" type="danger">
      Currently we are having issues with package managers other than pnpm on some systems, for now please ensure this
      is installed on your system to prevent issues down the road.
    </Note>

    Now we will install the package onto your system.

        ```bash copy
        npm install -g @umi-digital/cli
        ````
      </TabsContent>
      <TabsContent value="yarn">
        ```bash copy
        yarn add -g @umi-digital/cli
        ````
      </TabsContent>
    </Tabs>

    **Whilst installing the package be aware of any modules that are not installed correctly. If this happens contact
    the [project owner](mailto:isaac@umidigital.co.uk) immediately to organise a repair or remedy.**

  </StepItem>
  <StepItem title="Test Installation">
    Finally, we need to test the installation to ensure that it is on your system and working. To do this run:

    ```bash copy
    umi
    ```

    This should give you a read out something like this (this is subject to change as the package matures overtime):

    ```bash
    umi
    Usage: umi [options] [command]

    A CLI tool for project management

    Options:
    -v, --vers display the current version
    -h, --help display help for command

    Commands:
    init [options] Initialises a new project
    create [projectName] Creates a new project
    add [componentName] Adds components or features to your project
    remove [componentName] Removes components or features from your project
    help Displays help information for UMI CLI
