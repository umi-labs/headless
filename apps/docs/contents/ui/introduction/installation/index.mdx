To install the **UMI CLI**, you will need to check for several prerequisites, install the package globally and then ensure it is installed correctly on your system.

## Install

<Step>
<StepItem title="System Requirements">

  - **Node.js:** Make sure you have Node.js installed. This is crucial for the installation and use of the package.
  - **Package Manager:** This project was built to be package manager agnostic so that `pnpm`, `npm` and `yarn` commands all work the same, ensure that your chosen package manager is installed.

To verify installation, run:

  ```bash
  node -v
  ```

  > We are currently running support for node 18.19.0. However we are working bring a wider array of versions supported.

  And then checking your package manager of choice is installed, run:

  <Tabs defaultValue="pnpm" className="pt-5 pb-1">
    <TabsList className="">
      <TabsTrigger value="pnpm">pnpm</TabsTrigger>
      <TabsTrigger value="npm">npm</TabsTrigger>
      <TabsTrigger value="yarn">yarn</TabsTrigger>
    </TabsList>
    <TabsContent value="pnpm">
    ```bash copy
    pnpm -v
  ````
    </TabsContent>
    <TabsContent value="npm">
    ```bash copy
    npm -v
  ````
    </TabsContent>
    <TabsContent value="yarn">
    ```bash copy
    yarn -v
  ````
    </TabsContent>

  </Tabs>

</StepItem>
<StepItem title="Installation">
Now we will install the package onto your system.

<Tabs defaultValue="pnpm" className="pt-5 pb-1">
  <TabsList className="">
    <TabsTrigger value="pnpm">pnpm</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="npm">npm</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="yarn">yarn</TabsTrigger>
  </TabsList>
  <TabsContent value="pnpm">
  ```bash copy
  pnpm add -g @umi-digital/cli
````
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value="npm">
  ```bash copy
  npm install -g @umi-digital/cli
````
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value="yarn">
  ```bash copy
  yarn add -g @umi-digital/cli
````
  </TabsContent>
</Tabs>

**Whilst installing the package be aware of any modules that are not installed correctly. If this happens contact the [project owner](mailto:isaac@umidigital.co.uk) immediately to organise a repair or remedy.**

</StepItem>
<StepItem title="Test Installation">
Finally, we need to test the installation to ensure that it is on your system and working. To do this run:

```bash copy
umi
```

This should give you a read out something like this (this is subject to change as the package matures overtime):

```bash
umi
Usage: umi [options] [command]

  -v, --vers              display the current version

## Next Steps

Now you have the package installed on your system we can move to usage and find out how we can use the package to create, initialise, add to and remove from our headless projects.
