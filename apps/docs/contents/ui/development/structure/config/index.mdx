## Basic structure

```json
  {
    "title": "Button",
    "componentName": "Button",
    "description": "Button component config",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "category": "ui",
    "type": "",
    "schema": true,
    "additionalPackages": []
  }
```

Let's break down this structure:

The main things of note within this json structure are the `componentName`, `category`, `type` and `additionalPackages` values, these are all vital to the cli when pulling files into a project as they
lay out the key pieces of information in terms of what it is, where it's going and anything this component requires.

When building a new component in this package you always need to make sure that these are completed and completed to the nth degree - this avoided duplication, installation errors etc.

<Note title="Additonal Packages" type="warning">
  For the additionalPackages array please input the installation value of the package you are meaning as a string. e.g.
  `["motion"]` not `["npm install motion"]`.
  Additionally, include the types package if required e.g. `["motion", "@types/motion"]`.
